title: Create a private highly available container registry 
---

Instead of using the public Docker Hub registry, create your own private container registry using Azure Container Registry (ACR).

### Tasks


#### Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)

**Task Hints**
* Use the Azure CLI to create the ACR instance. There is [a guide in the Azure documentation on creating a new ACR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-azure-cli)
* You will have to pick a globally unique name for your new registry

{% collapsible %}

```sh
az acr create --resource-group <resource-group> --name <unique-acr-name> --sku Standard --location <location>
```

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Use Azure Container Registry Build to push the container images to your new registry

**Task Hints**
* ACR includes a feature called 'ACR Tasks' which can build container images remotely in Azure, and store the resulting image in the registry. [This guide in the ACR documentation covers how to run a quick build task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-tutorial-quick-task#build-in-azure-with-acr-tasks)
* The source code of the captureorder project is on GitHub here, `https://github.com/Azure/azch-captureorder.git` and can be checked out to your cloud shell session with `git`. It includes the `Dockerfile` to build the image.
* There is no need to run `az acr login` when working the the Cloud Shell.
* When running `az acr build` be careful with the last parameter which is the Docker build context directory, it's usual to `cd` into the directory where the `Dockerfile` is situated, and pass `.` (a single dot) as the build context
* You can tag and name the image however you wish, e.g. `captureorder:v1` or you might want to [use a variable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-tasks-reference-yaml#run-variables) to dynamically tag the image
  
{% collapsible %}

> **Note** The Azure Cloud Shell is already authenticated against Azure Container Registry. You don't need to do `az acr login` which also won't work on the Cloud Shell because this requires the Docker daemon to be running.

Clone the application code on Azure Cloud Shell

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azch-captureorder.git
cd azch-captureorder
```

Use Azure Container Registry Build to build and push the container images

```sh
az acr build -t "captureorder:{% raw %}{{.Run.ID}}{% endraw %}" -r <unique-acr-name> .
```

> **Note** On completion you'll get a build ID in a message similar to ``Run ID: cb1 was successful after 3m14s``. Use that Run ID (`cb1` in this example) as the image tag in the next step.

{% endcollapsible %}

#### Configure your application to pull from your private registry

Before you can use an image stored in a private registry you need to ensure your Kubernetes cluster has access to that registry. 

##### Grant AKS generated Service Principal to ACR

Authorize the AKS cluster to connect to the Azure Container Registry.

**Task Hints**
* To simplify the process of connecting AKS and ACR, there is a Azure CLI command you can run to update your cluster with the `--attach-acr` parameter. [This is covered in detail in the AKS documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/cluster-container-registry-integration#configure-acr-integration-for-existing-aks-clusters)

{% collapsible %}

```sh
az aks update -n <aks-cluster-name> -g <resource-group> --attach-acr <your-acr-name>
```

> **Note** If the above command results in an error, it's possible you may not have the necessary permissions to configure ACR access. If this happens, the following method may work.

```sh
AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP=<Resource Group where AKS is deployed>
AKS_CLUSTER_NAME=<Name of your AKS Cluster>
ACR_RESOURCE_GROUP=<Resource Group where ACR is deployed>
ACR_NAME=<Name of your Azure Container Registry>

# Get the id of the service principal configured for AKS
CLIENT_ID=$(az aks show --resource-group $AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME --query "servicePrincipalProfile.clientId" --output tsv)

# Get the ACR registry resource id
ACR_ID=$(az acr show --name $ACR_NAME --resource-group $ACR_RESOURCE_GROUP --query "id" --output tsv)

# Create role assignment
az role assignment create --assignee $CLIENT_ID --role acrpull --scope $ACR_ID
```

{% endcollapsible %}

After you grant your Kubernetes cluster access to your private registry, you can update your deployment with the image you built in the previous step.

Kubernetes is declarative and keeps a manifest of all object resources. Edit your deployment object with the updated image.

**Task Hints**
* You can edit a live deployment object in Kubernetes with `kubectl edit deployment`. It is suggested to run `export KUBE_EDITOR="nano"` to stop `kubectl` from using the `vi` editor.
* The image name will need to be fully qualified and include your registry name which will be of the form `<name>.azurecr.io/<image>:<tag>`

{% collapsible %}

From your Azure Cloud Shell run:

`kubectl edit deployment captureorder`

Replace the image tag with the location of the new image on Azure Container Registry. Replace `<build id>` with the ID you got from the message similar to ``Run ID: cb1 was successful after 3m14s`` after the build was completed.

> **Hint** `kubectl edit` launches `vim`. To search in `vim` you can type `/image: azch/captureorder`. Go into **insert** mode by typing `i`, and replace the image with `<unique-acr-name>.azurecr.io/captureorder:<build id>`

Quit the editor by hitting `Esc` then typing `:wq` and run `kubectl get pods -l app=captureorder -w`.

If you successfully granted Kubernetes authorization to your private registry you will see one pod terminating and a new one creating. If the access to your private registry was properly granted to your cluster, your new pod should be up and running within about 10 seconds.
