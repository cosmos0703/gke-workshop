Welcome to the Google Cloud Kubernetes Workshop. In this lab, you'll go through tasks that will help you master the basic and more advanced topics required to deploy a multi-container application to Kubernetes on [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/service?hl=ko). 

You can use this guide as a Kubernetes tutorial and as study material to help you get started to learn Kubernetes.

Some of the things youâ€™ll be going through:

- Kubernetes deployments, services and ingress
- Deploying MongoDB using Helm version 3
- Google Monitor for Containers, Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and the Cluster Autoscaler

You can review the [changelog](#changelog) for what has recently changed.
